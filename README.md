# Ride Together

This is a project developed for the first edition of the [geekathon](https://www.geekathon.dev/). 
We used [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) bootstrapped with [create-next-app](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Browse to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the app running (hopefully).

To lint the code, use:

```bash
npm run lint
# or
npm run lint-fix
```

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js. Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
